 Quantum computing represents a new paradigm in computation that utilizes the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. If you are reading this then you have undoubtedly heard that the promise of quantum computation lies in the possibility of efficiently performing a handful of tasks such as prime factorization, quantum simulation, and optimization; computations that at size are beyond the capabilities of even the largest of classical computers.
